# USWDS Upgrade

### Work Currently in Progress
**Implementation Plans**:  We have been executing the Implementation Plans for following projects:

### Collaboration with other Caseflow tools:
- Spinner code and generic error page copy can be used by other tools for loading pages and error messages.
- RO pilots highlighted how helpful Reader could be to RO staff. Once Reader works well at BVA, it would be great to discuss Reader beyond BVA.

### Concerns
- We're interviewing BVA staff before upcoming brief face and VACOLS process changes, to understand their current pain points and overall workflows. We think that workflows will change after brief faces go away, and are planning to interview key teams after the change. If the change is delayed until the start of October, we may need to delay the last piece of Work Queue discovery accordingly. We'll know more as the weeks pass, just raising this flag early.
